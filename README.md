# Rlon

Rlon is a procedural, stream-based syntax with fewer Parenthesis than lisp but more brackets than Racket. It features a unique, arcane syntax that forces a shift in the mindset of the programmer.

## Example
A programming language wouldn't be complete without a working hello world implementation:
````
(main)->{
  "Hello, World!"
}
````

## Execution
Rlon can currently only be executed as as either a Racket module language, or by the rlon program (windows only).

Ex.  
````> rlon hello.rlon````
